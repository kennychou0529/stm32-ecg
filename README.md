# stm32-ecg
**A low cost medical monitoring system project (ECG, Puse Oxymeter...) based on STM32 ARM Microcontroller with Arduino STM32 framework**

The goal of this project a to design a complete bio-medical monitoring system (for research and fun, not for real medical applications) with simple and low cost hardware.
